            <h3>Welcome to my gardening website! My name is Ally Forchic and I am a senior at Guilford College. The past four years at Guilford have taught me a lot about myself, and as I begin to come to the end of my college career, I will always be grateful for my time at Guilford and the people I have met here. Although physically my time at Guilford was cut short unexpectedly, adapting to an online curriculum has given me leisure time to indulge in my hobbies. That being said, for my last and final college assignment ever, I bring to you my gardening website! </h3>
