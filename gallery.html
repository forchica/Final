        <p id="titleofgallery">Gallery </p>
<p id="introtogallery"> I figured that I would need some credability to prove that I actually do have a little sense of knowledge when it comes to gardening. 
    
    <br> I have included a gallery page to showcase the work I have done in the last couple of weeks. Check it out!
    
    <br>(*Reminder I am absolutely not a professional -- this is simply a hobby!*)</p>

        <p id="liliescap"> These are lilies that I had bought back in the beginning of April. I can't take much credit for growing these, I only cared for them for a couple weeks before they began to bloom within the first few days of May!</p>

    <p id="cuccap">These are cucumbers that I have grown from seeds. They took a while to germinate and I honestly didn't expect them to grow due to the "expired" experation date on the seed packet. However after about a week and a half I saw sprouts and they have been on the rise since then! </p>
