        <p id="titleofgallery">Gallery </p>
<p id="introtogallery"> I figured that I would need some credability to prove that I actually do have a little sense of knowledge when it comes to gardening. 
    
    <br> I have included a gallery page to showcase the work I have done in the last couple of weeks. Check it out!
    
    <br>(*Reminder I am absolutely not a professional -- this is simply a hobby!*)</p>

    
    <p id="lilies">Lilies</p>
        <div class="imagecenter"> <img id="may5lilies" src="plantgallery/may5lilies.jpeg" alt="lilies" title="lilies"></div>

        <p id="liliescap"> These are lilies that I had bought back in the beginning of April. I can't take much credit for growing these, I only cared for them for a couple weeks before they began to bloom within the first few days of May!</p>

<p id="break">...</p>

    <p id="cucumber">Cucumbers</p>
    
    <div class="imagecenter"> <img id="may2cuc" src="plantgallery/may2cuc.jpeg" alt="cuc" title="cuc"></div>

    <p id="cuccap">These are cucumbers that I have grown from seeds. They took a while to germinate and I honestly didn't expect them to grow due to the "expired" experation date on the seed packet. However after about a week and a half I saw sprouts and they have been on the rise since then! </p>

    <p id="break">...</p>

    <p id="cucumber">Succulents</p>

    <div class="imagecenter"> <img id="suc1" src="plantgallery/succulent1.jpeg" alt="succulent" title="succulent"></div>

    <p id="succap"> This type of succulent is called a Hen & Chick, the bigger flower acts as the hen and reproduces smaller flowers known as chicks.
        The coolest part about these is that you can simply pull a baby chick out, repot it, and it will continue to grow and reproduce more chicks. These are some of my favorite plants, they require a good amount of sun but only need to be watered once a week if that.
        They're not only super easy to maintain, but super affordable!</p>
    </p>
    <div class="imagecenter"> <img id="suc2" src="plantgallery/succulent2.jpg" alt="succulent" title="succulent"></div>

    <p id="succap">These are all succulents that I have bought and replanted. I no longer remember the names of each individual type, but in the right of the pot you can see another type of Hen & Chick as mentioned above. Buying and repotting is super fun, as you can see I added a statue and pebbles to add some personality. (Check out my Greensboro Page for information on where these were found!)
