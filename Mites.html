        <p id="titleofmites">Mites </p>

<p>Plants can develop problems for a number of reasons, one of the most common problems being pests. Animals are often known to munch on plants and thriving plants may quickly show damage if mites pop up or an infestation begins. I have done my best to offer some guidance below based on how I have dealt with my plants having mites!
</p>

<p>There are many species of mites that can harm your plants. Wilting leaves, holes or dark spots on leaves, or yellowing of leaves can all be signs that your plant may have mites. It’s important to pay attention to your plant, mites can be easy to get rid of when they are still small in numbers, but they multiply quick and can even spread from one infected plant to a healthy one. Essentially, mites will feed on your plant until it dies, unless you do something about it
</p>
<p>They eat the leaves and roots of your plants, causing them visible damage after a while. If you believe that you have mites, your first step should be to inspect your plant. Figure out the shape, size and color of the mites and go from there... 
</p>

<p>In my experience, I have only dealt with mites once. I had two perennial pots that I leave outside all year long, my plants survived the winter, but I noticed that they were very wilted and not growing as big as I had expected once it started to get warmer. Upon examination I discovered that there were hundreds (I know, pretty gross) of these very small bugs that you weren’t able to see unless you were close. Not having done much research, I got rid of them. Which wasn’t the smartest option because after doing research, I discovered multiple techniques that can be used to treat plant mites, some easy at home options have been listed below
</p>

<ul>
<li>Soap and Water: By mixing this concoction, it is safe enough to not harm your plant, but the soap will do damage to the mites.
</li>
<li>Garlic Cloves (or onion): When I was reading about mites, one website described them as vampires, because they suck the nutrients out of your plants. Recently, my mother told me that she started to put garlic cloves into the soil about an inch or two from plant stems. Mites (like vampires) hate the smell of garlic. Strange but true!
</li>
<li>Tobacco or Orange Peels: Mites also despise tobacco, heat up water and let tobacco leaves sit in it (the longer the better) then add a little soap to it and spray directly on your plant. (This will also work with orange peels!)
</li>
<li>Salt/Pepper: Both of these can be used as well. If using pepper, boil water, add some hot pepper powder and a little vegetables oil. If using salt, mix one or two spoons of salt to a gallon of water. Spray mixes on plants.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Helpful Tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Before dousing your whole plant in a pesticide, try just a couple leaves, some plants can still be sensitive to certain ingredients!
</li>
<li>If you are using dish soap, make sure it is bleach free! Bleach will harm your plants.
</li>
<li>Be adamant about spraying the soil and the undersides of leaves, mites can hide there.
</li>

<li>These are natural pesticides, you won’t see results immediately, but if you keep up with your technique, you will see results!
